🧩 Classes Overview
1. Customer Class

Handles:

Personal info

Balance operations

Displaying customer data

2. Bank Class

🚧 Limitations

This is a basic console program, so it currently:

Doesn’t save data to a file

Has no password system

No authentication for admin

(If you want, I can add all of these.)

📈 Possible Future Improvements

I can help you implement any of these next:

File handling (save customers permanently)

Admin username/password

Transaction history

Edit customer details

Search by name/account number

Delete customer

Convert into GUI (Qt/WinForms)

Convert into a full database project (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
